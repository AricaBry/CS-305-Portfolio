# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that creates financial plans for customers such as savings, retirement, investment, and insurance plans. Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their operations and asked my company, Global Rain, for help in improving their software security. 

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
What I believe I did well when finding the client’s software security vulnerabilities is using both the Maven dependency check tool and a manual overview of the given code. I was able to catch areas in the code where input validation and error handling were needed. I also ensured the Maven Dependency check plugin was up to date so that there were no false vulnerabilities.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part for me was determining the best course of action for each vulnerability. However, most of the vulnerabilities found were because of out-of-date software.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by using static testing through the Dependency Check tool. There are so many different vulnerabilities that it would be extremely difficult to try and catch them all with a manual code review. To determine what mitigation techniques to use, I would use the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) site and the National Vulnerability Database(NVD) to find the best-fit solution for each vulnerability.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I reran the code after refactoring to ensure the code still compiled correctly. I also took a second look at the dependency report check to see if any new vulnerabilities occurred.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I plan to use the Maven Dependency tool and OWASP Dependency Check. I also plan to continue to use the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) site and the National Vulnerability Database(NVD).

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Personally, from this assignment, I would show employers how I was able to interpret the client's needs and determine relevant areas of security to focus on.
